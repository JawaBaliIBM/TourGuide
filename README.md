To get started building, we provide some template source code which you can use as a starting point. This repository contains web client that access APIs.

## Getting started

Download the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:JawaBaliIBM/TourGuide.git

### To run the Web App

This will create containers needed and start the app. You can access the web app at your local: http://localhost:8080.
